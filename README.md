# Telecommunications Laboratory Repository

Welcome to the Telecommunications Laboratory repository! This repository is dedicated to storing the scripts and files related to various lab activities in the field of telecommunications, including modulations and signal processing. Each folder corresponds to a specific lab activity, and the scripts within those folders are written in GNU Octave.

## Lab Activities

### Lab Activity 1: Signals Gerenation

Description: This lab activity introduces the basic concepts of signals in Octave.

- Folder: `Lab1`
- Files: `lab1.m`

### Lab Activity 2: Amplitude Modulation (AM)

Description: In this lab activity, you'll explore amplitude modulation, its characteristics, and demodulation techniques.

- Folder: `Lab2`
- Files: `lab2.m`

### Lab Activity 3: Angle Modulation (PM and FM)

Description: This lab covers frequency and phase modulation, its advantages, and techniques for both modulation and demodulation.

- Folder: `Lab3`
- Files: `lab03.m`
